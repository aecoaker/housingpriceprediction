# Housing Price Prediction
For a masters project, exploring some artificial data on housing sales and creating the best fit linear model for the price.

The data is structured as:
* elevation: Elevation of the base of the house
* dist_am1: Distance to Amenity 1
* dist_am2: Distance to Amenity 2
* dist_am3: Distance to Amenity 3
* bath: Number of bathrooms
* sqft: Square footage of the house
* parking: Parking type 
  "Not Provided" => parking is not provided as part of the house but street parking may be available
  "No Parking"=> Parking is not available near the house.
  You may also choose to merge the above two categories to a single "Parking not available" category
* precip: Amount of precipitation
* price: Final House Sale Price
